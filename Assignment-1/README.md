The website that interested me the most was the [Experiments with Google/WebGL](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL). Some of the ones that caught my eye were 
the WebGL Kaleidoscope. This was was cool because of the different colors and the way each peice looked like it was moving in different directions and at different speeds.
The second one that I thought was very cool was the WebGL Terrain. I liked this one the most because of how peaceful it looked and sounded. Overall, I thought this website was
interesting because it showed a lot of different variety in the creations people make with WebGL.

# Project Overview 
  - My idea for the final project is to make an art gallery. I will use different objects that I can find on the internet and place them all over the gallery. Each object will have different animations. The user will have a first person point of view to go around the gallery and look at everything. I will use lighting to illuminate different parts of the gallery.

# Project Schedule
  - Week 1: I will look for similar projects to see how I want my project to turn out. I will also find different objects that I can use.
  - Week 2: I will load all the different objects and start to add different transformations.  
  - Week 3: I will add the actual gallery and set up lighting in the correct spots. I will also set up the first person point of view for the user.
  - Week 4: I will finish any little things for my project and put together my presentation. 

# Project Technical Requirements  
  - I intend to use Three.js and JavaScript
